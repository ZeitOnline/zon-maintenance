Deactivate comments and user logins for maintenance tasks where emerge of data should be kept at minimum.

== Description ==

If you need to move a wordpress installation, especially a large multi user installation, from one domain 
to another, or want to do backup tasks and such maybe long timed work, where the blogs should be static 
for a amount of time, this plugin is for you.

What it does:

* Supplies a maintenance mode during which all comment forms are replaced with a message
* Message title and text is adjustable
* optionally logs out all non super admin users and prevents them from logging in

his is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the Github Updater Plugin to install
2. (Network) activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
